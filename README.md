# 🚨 Prank App 

## ⚠️ Important Notice
This app is a **personal project** created for **educational purposes only**. It explores Android system interactions by simulating temporary device unresponsiveness.

## ❗ Disclaimer
- 🚫 **Not a Real Utility**: This is a proof-of-concept app for learning Android development.
- ⚠️ **Use Responsibly**: Do **not** deploy it on others' devices without explicit consent.
- 🛠️ **Testing**: Test only on **emulators** or **spare devices**. The app may cause temporary frustration!
- ❗ **No Guarantees**: This project is experimental and may behave unpredictably on certain devices.

## 📌 Features
- **Fullscreen Activity Lock**: Prevents user interaction by blocking navigation buttons.
- **Max Volume Override**: Automatically sets media volume to the maximum.
- **Persistent Loop**: Forces user to confirm an action repeatedly.
- **Memory Consumption**: Simulates heavy RAM usage.
- **Overlay Lock**: Attempts to prevent closing the app.

## ⚠️ Dangerous Code (Commented Out)
The source code contains **commented-out functions** that could make a device **completely unresponsive** if executed. These include:

### 🧨 Fork Bomb (`forkBomb()`)
Opens multiple instances of the app repeatedly, causing the device to freeze.

```kotlin
//    private fun forkBomb(context: Context) {
//        while (true) {
//            val intent = Intent(context, MainActivity::class.java)
//            context.startActivity(intent)
//            context.startActivity(intent)
//            context.startActivity(intent) // Opens new instances of the app repeatedly
//        }
//    }
```

### 🔥 CPU Hang Attack (`hangDevice()`)
Runs an infinite loop of CPU-intensive operations, making the device unresponsive.

```kotlin
//    private fun hangDevice() {
//        while (true) {
//            // This runs in a loop, keeping the CPU busy
//            Math.sqrt(999999999.999)
//            Math.sqrt(999999999.999)
//            Math.sqrt(999999999.999)
//        }
//    }
```

### 💀 **Phone Kill Attacks (Commented Out for Safety)**

```kotlin
// forkBomb(this)
// hangDevice()
```
🚨 **These functions are commented out for safety reasons. Running them may require a hard reset or factory reset to recover the device!**
